# DynStone
DynStone is a project created around the idea of dynamic Eddystone BLE Beacons

This project was developed during an internship at BBR Verkehrstechnik GmbH. The goal was the create a system, in which we can use the functionality of originally static Eddystone Beacons for dynamic transmitting of information in the case of railway systems. The hardware used for the beacons in this project is the affordable ESP32.  

Provided are multiple files. Two of those are .ino files which can be directly uploaded to an ESP32 and one python script (or the compiled .exe) that is used for communicating to the ESP32 via the serial port in an easy to understand GUI (partly written in german).
